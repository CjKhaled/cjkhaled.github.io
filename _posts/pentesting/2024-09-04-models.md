## Introduction

A model for penetration testing defines what should and shouldn't be done. A good one will guide the process in a beneficial way, and provide consistent results when followed repeatedly. A framework provides more structure, allowing one to specify instances of each model element.

To view any of these in more depth, have a look at the resources at the bottom of this page.

### Flaw Hypothesis Model

This is the first penetration testing model that was developed. The idea of this model is that if you don't have a formal method to prove that a system is secure, penetrations are the most effective method for assessing vulnerabilities. The four stages associated with this model are:

- Knowledge of the system control structure: what the tester must understand about the system to determine what can go wrong. This can be from reading system manuals or studying literature from past exploits.
- Generate flaw hypothesis: record probable flaws based on research
- Confirm them: carry out live tests of suspected flaws, and demonstrate their existence
- Generalize them: identify and outline broad, recurring vulnerabilities that are common across systems, and identify underlying causes and remediations. 

### Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual

This is a popular model that has a lot of content to peel over, so I'll just give a tldr instead. The objective is to answer question of the Security Testing Audit Report (STAR). When using this model, you should track:

- What you test (targets)
- How you test them
- Types of controls discovered
- What you did not test

The model is designed to guarantee:

- The test was conducted thoroughly
- The test included all necessary elements.
- The activities of the test complied with the law.
- The results are quantifiably measurable.
- The results are consistent and repeatable.
- The results contain only facts as derived from the tests themselves.
