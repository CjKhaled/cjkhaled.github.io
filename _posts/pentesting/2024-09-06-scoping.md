## Introduction
The easiest way to assess the security of a system is to charactertize it in 3 elements:
- Confidentiality: System resources that are private, stay private
- Integrity: System can not be changed in a way that's unintended
- Availability: System resources should always be available to users

A penetration test is an activity in which the security of a program, system, or network is evaluated by attempting to exploit a vulnerability. Companies usually get these because they want to assess their risk and prioritize their remediations because of some external requirement. 

Scoping is a very important part of the penetration testing process. This sets the precendent for what you are going to test, and what the client can expect from that test. Despite what you are testing, some important topics for this meeting include:
- What does the client want tested 
Estimating the effort required based on your experience and their requirements. Pad this by at least 20% for scope screep and unexpected events
- Include work-stoppage dates
- Verify ownership/control of the machines to be tested
- Why the customer is having the penetration test. If it is for some requirement, make sure you can actually satisfy this requirement.
- When the customer wants the active portions of the penetration test conducted

For the next few sections, I'll go over some questions you may want to ask based on what you are testing. This is not an exhaustive list by any means.

## Network

How many internal/external IP addresses are being tested?

What are they?

Are there any firewalls, IDS/IPS, or anything else that will limit access to the system?

When a machine is penetrated, what can we do?

## Web

How many web apps are being assessed?

How many login systems are being assessed?

How many static pages are there? How many dynamic ones?

Can we have access to the source code?

Is there any documentation?

Will we perform static analysis?

Will there be fuzzing?

Will there be role-based testing?

Can you provide any credentials?

## Wireless

How many wireless networks are in place?

Is a guest wireless network used? Does it have authentication?

What type of encryption is being used?

What is the square footage of coverage?

Will we enumerate rogue devices?

Are we allowed to attack clients on the network?

How many clients use the network?

## Social Engineering

What level of phising is desired?

What level of telephone recon is desired?

Do you want to attempt to gain unauthorized physical access?

## Conclusion

When carrying out a penetration test, it's very important to make sure you test the correct machines. Inevitably, you may reach a third-party provider (like cloud, ISP, etc). They usually have some constraints that you need to abide by. Different regions have different laws when it comes to penetration testing, so it is important to take note of this as well.
